## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive tutorial on **Active Learning**, covering its theoretical foundations, strategies, and real-world applications. The tutorial is presented in both Jupyter Notebook and HTML formats to ensure accessibility and ease of use.

Active Learning is a machine learning paradigm that prioritizes data efficiency by actively selecting the most informative data points for labeling. This tutorial includes practical examples and code to help you implement Active Learning strategies in your own projects.

## Repository Contents
- **`active_learning_tutorial.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full tutorial, including explanations, code, and visualizations.
- **`index.html`**: The HTML version of the notebook for users who prefer to view the content without executing code.

## Features
- Explanation of key concepts in **Active Learning**.
- Mathematical foundations, including entropy and KL divergence.
- Popular Active Learning strategies such as:
  - Uncertainty Sampling
  - Query-by-Committee
  - Density-Weighted Methods
- Real-world applications in:
  - Medical imaging
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Self-driving cars
- Step-by-step code implementation with Python.
